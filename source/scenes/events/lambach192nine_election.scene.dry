= DNVP CHOOSES THEIR NEW LEADER

  DNVP Leadership Conference

Following the internal crisis triggered by the Young Plan and the party’s strategic fragmentation, the German National People’s Party convenes an extraordinary leadership conference. Years of factional conflict between monarchists, agrarian ultras, parliamentary conservatives, and the emerging Young Conservative current have left the DNVP without a coherent strategic line. With Hugenberg’s departure from the organization and his supporters forming a rival nationalist bloc, the DNVP must now redefine its position within the Right and decide whether to pursue opposition, collaboration, or structural reform.

The delegates enter the conference sharply divided. The agrarian Landbund faction seeks to reassert traditional dominance; the Young Conservatives push for a parliamentary-national reorientation; the militarist wing demands a restorationist-authoritarian course; and a range of technocrats and economic nationalists advocate a controlled modernization program to compete with the NSDAP. The outcome of this contest will determine whether the DNVP stabilizes as a mainstream conservative force, radicalizes, or disintegrates into competing nationalist fragments.

Delegates must now select the new party chairman from among several competing currents—each representing a distinct ideological trajectory and coalition strategy for the party.

- @trevi: Treviranus gets elected!
- @lambuch: Lambuch is re-elected!
- @martin: Martin gets elected!
- @westarp: Westarp remains in the power!
- @quaatz: Quaatz takes over!
- @trotha: Trotha takes over!
- @oldenburg: Oldenburg gets elected!
