= Fundraising

For better or for worse, the party cannot exist without money.

- @maintain: Maintain our current dues.
- @reduce: Reduce dues.
- @increase: Increase dues.

@maintain
subtitle: [+ dues +] resources gained.
on-arrival: resources += dues;

We maintain our current dues.

@reduce
subtitle: [+ dues - 1 +] resources gained.
choose-if: dues > 1
on-arrival: dues -= 1; resources += dues; left_dissent -= 8; center_dissent -= 8; reformist_dissent -= 8; labor_dissent -= 8; unemployed_spd += 10; workers_spd += 5

Our current members appreciate this, but no one decides to join a party because of the low dues.

@increase
subtitle: [+ dues + 2 +] resources gained. [? if unemployed >= 15 : Given the present economic situation, this may be painful. ?][? if dues >= 4 : Dues are already rather high; increasing them might reduce our membership. ?]
on-arrival: dues += 2; resources += dues; workers_spd -= 5; unemployed_spd -= 10; workers_spd -= 3 if unemployed >= 15; unemployed_spd -= 15 if unemployed >= 15; workers_spd -= 3*dues if dues >= 6; unemployed_spd -= 3*dues if dues >= 6
view-if: dues <= 4

Our members grumble at this, and some of the less committed members leave. But now, we have access to additional resources. 

[? if unemployed >= 15 : Because of the presently high unemployment, our members are feeling the extra burden hard. ?]
