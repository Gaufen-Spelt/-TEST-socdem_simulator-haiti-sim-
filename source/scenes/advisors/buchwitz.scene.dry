= Otto Bushwitz

A Great War veteran and a neorevisionist leader, Kurt Schumacher argues for a strong resistance against the Nazis. As tireless anti-fascist, Schumacher may appeal to the workers through indirect abilities but fierce resonance to the youth. Either his actions or his impatience speed up his effectiveness.
